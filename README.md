Very cool AI Bot

Can do fun stuff like, uh, react to your messages.

God, I am so tired.

Okay, fuck it, I'll add the description tomorrow.

## Installation

1. Get Miniconda3 from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
2. Download all the Git files.
3. Go to the downloaded folder.
4. Run two setup files
- For MacOS/Linux:
```
cd Discord_Buddy
sh ./setup_linux_macos.sh
```
4. set your Discord Token and API Keys in .env (if it's hidden on Mac, press `shift + command + .` to display hidden files).
5. Run the bot through the launcher via script:
- On Windows, double-click the launcher.

`sh ./launcher_linux_macos.sh`

I will upload gifs, screenshots, and all that, but after like, I get sleep. Ok.
