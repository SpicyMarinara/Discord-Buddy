### Setup

1. Get Miniconda3 from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
2. Download all the Git files and unzip them.
3. Go to the downloaded folder.
4. Run one of the two setup files, depending on your system:

- For Windows (double click it):
```
setup_windows.bat
```

- For MacOS/Linux (in console):
```
cd Discord_Buddy
sh ./setup_linux_macos.sh
```

5. Set your Discord Token and API Keys in .env (if it's hidden on Mac, press `shift + command + .` to display hidden files).

6. Paste your Discord token and your API Keys in the selected fields of the .env file. Remember about the quotation marks!

7. Run the bot through the launcher via script:
- On Windows, double-click the launcher.
- On MacOS/Linux, run:
`sh ./launcher_linux_macos.sh`

That's it!

Alternatively, in case you experience any issues with the scripts, you can create a new conda environment yourself using provided 'environment.yml' file, by opening Anaconda Prompt and running following commands:
`cd /your/bot/location`
`conda env create -f environment.yml` - only required for the first time
`conda activate discord_bot`
`python main.py`

IMPORTANT: The console needs to be working in the background for the bot to work.

### APIs

My old tutorials on how to get API Keys:
- Claude (paid): https://rentry.org/marinaraclaude
- Gemini (has a free quota): https://rentry.org/marinaraspaghetti

Personally, I recommend grabbing a custom API Key from OpenRouter and using their free models, like DeepSeek:
